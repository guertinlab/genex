# ChIP-seq experiments

ChIP-seq measures protein abundance on DNA and one can quantify
protein modifications if an antibody to the modification is
available. 

# ChIP-seq experimental design

We performed ChIP-seq of HA-tagged ZNF143 in HEK-293T cells with mock IP (no antibody) as a control. 

# ChIP-seq analysis

First, we name the experiments with the trailing name being `PE1` or `PE2` for paired end data. 

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
for i in *_S*R1_001.fastq.gz
do
	nm=$(echo $i | awk -F"/" '{print $NF}' | awk -F"_S" '{print $1}')
    	echo $nm
	two=$(echo $i | awk -F"/" '{print $NF}' | awk -F"R1_001.fastq.gz" '{print $1}')
	mv $i ${nm}_PE1.fastq.gz
	mv ${two}R2_001.fastq.gz ${nm}_PE2.fastq.gz
done
```

## Cut off the adapter with `cutadapt`

In our daily workflow in the lab we use
`cutadapt` to remove adapter sequences. The options we use below are:

- `-j` for the number of cores to use
- `-m` specifies the minimal length of a read to keep after adapter sequence removal
- `-O` is the number of bases to trim off the end of the read if it overlaps with the adapter sequence 
- `-a` adapter sequence of PE1 reads 
- `-A` adapter sequence of PE2 reads
- `-o` PE1 output file 
- `-p` PE2 output file

The last two positional arguments are the input `fastq` files. Save the output
to a log file.

If the genome contains 25% of each base, then you would expect one quarter of the
reads that have no adapter to have the trailing base
trimmed. Likewise, approximately 1/16 of the remaining
reads without the adapter will have the final two bases
trimmed. Technically these values are not exact, because the reads with
matches to longer trailing k-mers (in this case 19-mers) would be
removed first, then 18-mer matches removed, etc. Each group has two sets of files: the experimental and the control. We can process these both in series using a loop that determines the output file names from the processed input files and performs the same operation on each set of files.  


```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
module load cutadapt
for i in *PE1.fastq.gz
do
    name=$(echo $i | awk -F"/" '{print $NF}' | awk -F"_PE1" '{print $1}')
    echo $name
    echo unzipping $i
    gunzip $i
    echo unzipping ${name}_PE2.fastq.gz
    gunzip ${name}_PE2.fastq.gz
    cutadapt -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA -A AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT -j 8 -m 10 -O 1 -o ${name}_PE1_no_adapt.fastq -p ${name}_PE2_no_adapt.fastq ${name}_PE1.fastq ${name}_PE2.fastq 2>&1 | tee ${name}_cutadapt.log
done
```
## Align to the human genome

Now we are aligning to the `hg38.fa` genome. We first need to "build" a set of index files for the hg38 genome. These files are necessary so the `bowtie2` software can efficiently search the genome for the input sequences. You can Google and click around the UCSC genome browser website to find genome files, but the code to download from the Terminal is shown below. We also need a file that has all the information about chromosome sizes later in the vignette, so we will download that as well. Next, we make a `genex` folder in the home directory and a `genomes` file in the `genex` directory, then move these files the files to the `genomes` folder and navigate to this directory. Finally, we can build the indicies with `bowtie2-build`. This takes a bit of time and we only need to perform these actions once per genome, so we already did this for you. You will have a chance to build the mitochondrial DNA chromosome alignment indicies later when you analyze ATAC data.


```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
# make a directory for the class
mkdir ~/genex

# now for the genome files
mkdir ~/genex/genomes

#navigate to this directory 
cd ~/genex/genomes

#download the genome file
wget https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/hg38.fa.gz

#unzip
gunzip hg38.fa.gz

#download a file that lists the size of chrs
wget https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/hg38.chrom.sizes

# build indicies
bowtie2-build hg38.fa hg38_bt2
```

Note that the libraries are paired end. The `-1` and
`-2` options are for the respective paired-end `fastq` files. There is no
need to save the output `sam` file, so the output is piped to
`samtools` to convert to `bam`, then sorted by name (`-n`) so paired
end reads are adjacent in the file, then piped to `samtools fixmate`
which adds information about the fragment length by comparing the PE1
and PE2 coordinates. Then the files are sorted by coordinate and 
piped to `samtools markdup` to remove duplicate reads. Duplicate reads
have the same PE1 and PE2 ends. This is very unlikely to happen by
chance unless you sequence to very high read depth, so these reads are
considered PCR amplicon duplicates. The `fixmate` step is necessary to
pipe to `markdup`. We use the entire DNA fragment for making the
browser tracks, which is accomplished by converted the paired-end
`bam` file to a `bed12` and taking out discordant reads. We are defining discordant as the two ends of the DNA fragments being greater that 2kb away from one another. This is unlikely given the size of or sonicated DNA and the Illumina sequencing platform. Then we normalize to read depth, add a trackline so we can upload into the UCSC genome browser, and make a `bigWig` file, which is very similar to a `bedGraph`, but it binary and not human-readable. 


The software `seqOutBias` software incorporates whether a read is uniquely mappable when converting a `bam` file to a `bed` and `bigWig`. This requires a compute-intensive task of looking at all k-mers (sequencing read length, here it is 40 bases) in the genome and determining if they are unique. Since this takes a bit of time, we performed this task for you and the resultant files are within the `~/genex/genomes/` directory.  

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
# generate mappability file
seqOutBias seqtable hg38.fa --read-size=40

```
# Combining replicates for the genome browser

Usually we combine replicates into a single track for visualization
and we compare the tracks between conditions. It is important that we
read-depth normalize before we combine the signal from each
replicate. Otherwise, we would be weighting replicates differently;
for example, if a library is sequenced to twice the read depth and we
combine first then read depth normalize, then the more high coverage
data is weighted twice as much in the final visualization. We will perform this step for the class, since you are all operating on your individual replicates independently.

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
#!/bin/bash
sizes=~/genex/genomes/hg38.chrom.sizes

for i in *rep1_PE1.fastq.gz
do
    nm=$(echo $i | awk -F"/" '{print $NF}' | awk -F"_PE1.fastq.gz" '{print $1}')
    name=$(echo $nm | awk -F"_rep1" '{print $1}')
    echo $name
    reps=$(ls ${name}_rep*normalized.bigWig | wc -w | bc)
    echo $reps
    files=$(ls ${name}_rep*normalized.bigWig)
    echo $files
    bigWigMerge $files tmp.bg
    scaleall=$(bc <<< "scale=4 ; 1.0 / $reps")
    echo scale:
    echo $scaleall
    awk -v scaleall="$scaleall" '{OFS="\t";} {print $1, $2, $3, $4*scaleall}' tmp.bg > ${name}_normalized.bedGraph
    rm tmp.bg
    wigToBigWig ${name}_normalized.bedGraph $sizes ${name}.bigWig
    awk -v var="$name" 'BEGIN {  print "browser position chr11:5,289,521-5,291,937"; print "track type=bedGraph name=\"" var "\" description=\"" var "_bedGraph\" visibility=full autoScale=on alwaysZero=on color=0,0,0"}  { print $0}' ${name}_normalized.bedGraph > ${name}_header_normalized.bedGraph
    gzip ${name}_header_normalized.bedGraph
done
```
# Peak calling

The next step is to use the aligned reads to call peaks. The code below will work if you have 1 replicate or many replicates. You will call peaks with your single replicate. We will combine the replicates and use the same command to get a peak set that uses all the replicates. We empirically found that this method typically captures the peaks of interest. If we were to call peaks in each replicate, we could combine peaks in various ways. The lower intensity peaks are the peaks that will change between replicates and these tend to be less important biologically. We believe it is important to have a single peak set per factor and we tend to be permissive with calling peaks and then try to determine which peaks to carry forward. Here we will determine an intensity threshold for peaks by only considering intensity quantiles of peaks that are enriched near genes that are changing expression when ZNF143 is degraded. In the past I have used the presence of a sequence motif or arbitrarily set a threshold for 2 orders of magnitude dynamic range to establish a threshold. 

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
# this is to activate the macs2 module on the CSHL computers
conda activate macs2
# make a directory to store temporary files
mkdir temp_macs
# call peaks 
macs2 callpeak --call-summits -t *_ZNF143_*bam -c *mock*bam -n ZNF143_ChIP -g hs -q 0.01 --keep-dup all -f BAMPE --nomodel --tempdir temp_macs
```
## Removing peaks on contigs and within blacklisted regions

You can Google "blacklisted genomic regions" to find a
set of region in the genome in `bed` format that have an over-representation of
reads regardless of the experiment. Recall this is even more necessary
because we do not have a control data set. We can also remove peaks on non-canonical chromosomes with
`grep -v`. All intervals in the summits file span one base, so we extend this region by a fixed value for each peak using `slopBed`. These 101 base intervals will be used as input for de novo motif analysis. The 401 base intervals will be used to calculate peak intensity. The rationale for a smaller window for motif analysis is the following: 1) the motif is typically very close to the peak summit, 2) larger window increases the computation time substantially, and 3) the flanking sequence is less enriched for the relevant motifs and de novo motif analysis is less sensitive with higher noise relative to background. We use a standard window size to calculate peak intensity, but we use a much wider window because signal 200 bases up or downstream can result from signal. We could increase the window to 600 bases and that would be fine as well. You can vary this window systematically and determine if varying the window affects the relative peak intensity rank. We use the same window size for each peak because otherwise wider windows (note the `narrowPeaks` file outputs are variable width) would inherently have more reads. 

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
wget https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/Blacklist/raw/master/lists/hg38-blacklist.v2.bed.gz
gunzip hg38-blacklist.v2.bed.gz
blacklist=hg38-blacklist.v2.bed
sizes=~/genex/genomes/hg38.chrom.sizes

# we only have one summits file (we only ChIPed on factor), but I am keeping the "loop" structure so it can be adapted for serial analysis.
for i in *_summits.bed
do
	name=$(echo $i | awk -F"/" '{print $NF}' | awk -F"_summits.bed" '{print $1}')
	echo $name
	grep -v "random" ${name}_summits.bed | grep -v "chrUn" | grep -v "chrEBV" | grep -v "chrM" | grep -v "alt" | intersectBed -v -a - -b $blacklist > ${name}_summits_final.bed
	slopBed -b 50 -i ${name}_summits_final.bed -g $sizes  | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n > ${name}_summit_100window.bed
   	slopBed -b 200 -i ${name}_summits_final.bed -g $sizes  | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n > ${name}_summit_400window.bed
done
```
# Fraction of Reads in Peaks (FRiP) 

A common metric to assess the quality of ChIP-seq data is fraction of reads in peaks. This can be informative, but let's go in depth about this metric. If we reduce the stringency of peak calling, then we have more genomic regions and FRiP increases—so we can have any number of FRiP score for one set of data. Also peak sets change between datasets. If we call peaks with two different replicates and call peaks in each, then we have two different peaks sets and it is not fair to compare FRiP between them. To avoid this we call a set of universal peaks for a factor; recall that we just use all `bam` files and perform one peak calling step. Next we count reads in this universal peak set for all replicates and we can directly compare FRiP between replicates.    

## Counting reads in peaks 

The `mapBed` subcommand from `bedtools` counts the BED file from the `seqOutBias` output in the 400 base window peak summits file. The `samtools` commands counts the number of paired end 1 reads that aligned in a concordant pair (the mate aligned nearby). The final output file contains these two values that we use to calculate FRiP.

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
name=ZNF143_ChIP
sort -k1,1 -k2,2n ${name}_summit_400window.bed > ${name}_summit_window_sorted.bed
peaks=${name}_summit_window_sorted.bed

for i in *_not_scaled.bed
do
	nm=$(echo $i | awk -F"/" '{print $NF}' | awk -F"_not_scaled.bed" '{print $1}')
	sort -k1,1 -k2,2n $i > ${nm}_sorted.bed
	mapBed -null '0' -a $peaks -b ${nm}_sorted.bed > ${nm}_peak_counts.txt 
	sleep 1
done

for i in *_peak_counts.txt
do
	name=$(echo $i | awk -F"/" '{print $NF}' | awk -F"_peak_counts.txt" '{print $1}')
	awk '{print $NF}' ${name}_peak_counts.txt > ${name}_peak_counts_only.txt
	echo $name | cat - ${name}_peak_counts_only.txt > ${name}_peak_counts.txt
	aligned_reads=$(samtools view -c -f 0x42 ${name}.bam)
	echo $aligned_reads >> ${name}_peak_counts.txt
	rm ${name}_peak_counts_only.txt
done

echo -e "chr\tstart\tend\tname\tqvalue" | cat - $peaks | paste -d'\t' - *peak_counts.txt > Combined_ZNF143_peak_counts_with_ChIP.txt
```
# Using the UCSC genome browser

We will take the file `_header_normalized.bedGraph`, zip it and upload to UCSC.


# *De novo* motif analysis at peaks

The coordinate `bed` file is converted to a sequence `fasta` file, then we perform *de novo* motif analysis with `meme`. The lab performs motif analysis frequently, so we have many options invoked when we call `meme` below. You can always use `meme -h` to determine the function of each option/parameter.

# Which ZNF143 peaks functionally regulate transcription?

Navigate to your `/Users/admin/genex` folder and open `R`. We performed PRO-seq after 30 minutes of ZNF143 degradation and identified activated and repressed genes. We also found comparable genes that are unchanged, but matched for the expression levels. We are going to ask "for each of these genes sets, how far away do we have to move from the transcription start site to find the first ZNF143 peaks in each quantile?"


```{r echo=F, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="TFs tend to act near their gene targets"}

```

## Ranking and quantile parsing of ChIP peaks

The first step is to generate BED files that are ranked by their intensity, parsed into separate files, and named according to their quantile.
```{r, engine='R', eval=F, echo=T}
#libraries
library(DESeq2)
library(lattice)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(limma)
library(bigWig)

peak.intensities = read.table('PEAKS_file_from_FRiP.bed', header =FALSE)

#NEEDS EDITS
names(peak.intensities) = rownames(normalized.counts.znf143)
chr = sapply(strsplit(names(peak.intensities), ":"), "[", 1)
rnge = sapply(strsplit(names(peak.intensities), ":"), "[", 2)
start =	as.numeric(sapply(strsplit(rnge, "-"), "[", 1)) + 100
end = as.numeric(sapply(strsplit(rnge, "-"), "[", 2)) - 100

quantile(peak.intensities, probs = seq(.05, 1.00, by = .05))

j =0 
q=seq(.05, 1.00, by = .05)
count=0
for (i in quantile(peak.intensities, probs = seq(.05, 1.00, by =
.05)))
{
count = count +1

write.table(file = paste0('quantile', as.character(q[count]), '.bed'), data.frame(chr[peak.intensities > j & peak.intensities <= i], start[peak.intensities > j & peak.intensities <= i], end[peak.intensities > j & peak.intensities <= i], peak.intensities[peak.intensities > j & peak.intensities <= i]), sep = '\t', quote=FALSE, col.names=FALSE, row.names=FALSE )
j = i
}
```
## Integration with PRO-seq data

We degraded ZNF143 for 30 minutes and performed PRO-seq. We can use these data to determine if ZNF143 is activating genes and estimate the dynamic range of peak intensities that are detectably regulating gene expression (so-called functional peaks).

Download the activated, repressed, and matched files from `https://github.com/guertinlab/genex/tree/main/ChIP_analysis`. Concatenate these files into a list of activated and repressed genes that change upon ZNF143 depletion and their matched genes.

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
